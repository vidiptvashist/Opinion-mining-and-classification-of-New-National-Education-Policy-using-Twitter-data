# Opinion-mining-and-classification-of-New-National-Education-Policy-using-Twitter-data

With the growth of technology in recent years, there has also been a rapid increase in the 
usage of social media sites to exchange information and beliefs. Opinion mining, also known 
as sentiment analysis, is used to ascertain public opinion. It is a technique for natural 
language processing. Sentiment analysis can be characterised as a technique that utilises 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the mining of attitudes, opinions, 
perspectives, and emotions from text, audio, tweets, and database sources. We gathered data 
from the microblogging website Twitter regarding the New Education Policy (NEP 2020-
2022) in order to have a better understanding of the public mood on a national level.
Convenience of social media especially Twitter is that it empowers the swift collection of 
information about the opinions of the public and individual users on current continuing 
topics. We employed models to classify and assess the emotion elicited by a compilation of 
around 22,000 tweets about the topic of New Education Policy (NEP). We carried out our 
investigation using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF and discovered that CountVectorizer 
outperformed TF-IDF. Additionally, we used Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, and discovered that 
Logistic Regression provided the highest assorting accuracy
